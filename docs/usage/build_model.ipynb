In part, an `Atlans` Model consists of a collection of SoilColumns that contain a subcolumn for groundwater, consolidation, oxidation and shrinkage (see [Model components](../core/index.qmd)). The processes leading to subsidence are determined at the voxel level. This means: each subcolumn contains the individual voxels with the specific process that will contribute to subsidence that is chosen by the user. \n",
