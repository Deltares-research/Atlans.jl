# How to install
First download and install the [current stable release of Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release). Please see [platform specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) for further installation instructions and if you have trouble installing Julia.

If you are new to Julia, it may be a good idea to check out the [Getting Started section of the Julia Manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/). Links to other learning resources can be found at [julialang.org/learning](https://julialang.org/learning/).

### Installing as Julia package
In the Julia REPL:
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Atlans")
```

or, enter the package manager by pressing `]` and type:
```julia-repl
pkg> add Atlans
```

To install the latest development version from the GitHub repository directly, enter the package manager and use:
```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/Deltares-research/Atlans.jl.git
```

Check installation by:
```julia-repl
julia> using Atlans
```

The first time this will take longer as any package that is new or changed needs to be pre-compiled first, to allow faster loading on subsequent uses. No error messages should appear, indicating that you have now successfully installed Atlans.
