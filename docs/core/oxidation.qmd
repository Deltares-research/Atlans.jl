title: "Oxidation"

# Process
Oxidation occurs in organic rich layers (e.g. peat) above the groundwater table.

# Calculation methods
For oxidation two approaches are supported ([Bootsma et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-382-415-2020): a more comprehensive organic mass based approach where the organic matter content determines the potential amount of surface lowering and a more simple oxidation at a constant rate.
