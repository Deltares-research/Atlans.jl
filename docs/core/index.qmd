# Subjects to cover in this page:
- The input model for the subsidence calculcations is constructed from the subsurface model and groundwater table.
- Time dimensions is categorized in terms of stress periods and time steps (@fig-schematic b). A stress period is the time during which a constant stress is applied (for example the surface water stage in a management area or a surcharge). Within a stress period, time is discretized into individual timesteps. A stress period therefore generally consists of multiple timesteps. A complete model simulation can consist of one or multiple stress periods which may all vary in duration.
- In each time step, a consolidation, oxidation and shrinkage calculation is performed and the resulting loss in elevation due to each process is stored.

- Core of Atlantis are the Model and Simulation objects
- Explanation of what the model consists of -> a collection of columns consisting of 4 types of columns -> groundwater, consolidation, oxidation and shrinkage columns (maybe include figure of this concept)
- Explanation of a column. Only discuss the four components (gw, cons, ox, shr) briefly as this will be covered in the respective pages.
- Current calculation methods which are supported by Atlantis and including or ignoring these in the modelling

# Model
The total model area is discretized by a grid of rectangalur cells. The cell size of the grid is depending on the input data and for all cells that have .
