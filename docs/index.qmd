title: "Atlantis Subsidence (Atlans)"
---

Atlantis is a modelling environment which is implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). The source code can found in the [Atlans repository](https://gitlab.com/deltares/subsidence/atlans.jl.git).

# Installation

Atlans is available in the general package registry. Installation in the Julia REPL:
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Atlans")
```

or, from the package manager (press `]` in the Julia REPL to enter):
```julia-repl
pkg> add Atlans
```

# Background

Atlantis is a tool that can be used to create regional and national scale predictions of soil subsidence based on 3D voxelmodels of the subsurface buildup and scenarios of for example phreatic groundwater level management.

Subsidence is calculated per 1D subsurface column as the sum of a combination of three processes: [consolidation](core/consolidation.qmd), [oxidation](core/oxidation.qmd) and [shrinkage](core/shrinkage.qmd). In general, Atlantis does not consider horizontal interaction between individual columns. Currently, the only horizontal interaction is the possibility to apply a periodic groundwater table lowering based on the median subsidence within a regional area (for example within weir areas).

Besides the 3D subsurface model, the predictions of subsidence heavily rely on an input groundwater table which is typically a long-term mean lowest groundwater table (MLGT; in Dutch: GLG). This groundwater table is used to determine the depths where oxidation and shrinkage processes contribute to subsidence. Furthermore, calculations of consolidation use the groundwater table to determine water- and exchange pore-pressures. The modelling concepts and equations are explained further on the [Atlantis](core/index.qmd) page and an explanation of the installation, along with examples of the usage can be found on the [Usage](usage/index.qmd) page.
